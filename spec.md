Below is a comprehensive, developer-ready specification that covers all aspects—from functional requirements to architecture, data handling, error management, and testing—so a developer can immediately begin implementation.

## 1. Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Create a personal system that organizes a healthy exercise training menu and a general food list. The goal is to support muscle gain, improved endurance, and overall health maintenance through a static weekly plan that automatically updates based on performance tracking and progression guidelines.

**Target Platforms:**  
- Web  
- Mobile (via a cross-platform framework)

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

### A. Exercise Training Menu

- **Weekly Schedule:**  
  - **Frequency:** 5 days per week  
  - **Session Duration:** 1 to 1.5 hours per session

- **Workout Types:**  
  - **Weightlifting (3 days/week):**  
    - **Split:** Upper/lower body split  
    - **Exercise Rotation:**  
      - Provides a variety of exercises per session (e.g., for upper body: bench press, overhead press, dumbbell/cable rows; for lower body: squats, lunges, deadlifts)  
      - The plan rotates exercises each week to ensure balanced development and prevent monotony.
    - **Warm-Up & Cool-Down:** Tailored routines for upper vs. lower body sessions (dynamic warm-ups, mobility drills, static stretches, foam rolling, and light cool-down exercises).
  
  - **Cardio/HIIT (2 days/week):**  
    - **Workout Structure:**  
      - Alternates between steady-state cardio (e.g., running, cycling) and HIIT (e.g., sprint intervals, circuit bodyweight routines).
    - **Warm-Up & Cool-Down:** Tailored routines that include light aerobic warm-ups, dynamic movements, and cool-down stretches focusing on cardiovascular recovery.

### B. Food Plan

- **Dietary Approach:**  
  - Balanced macronutrient intake.
  
- **Plan Details:**  
  - Provides a general direction with food categories and a few example items rather than detailed recipes.
  - **Differentiation by Training Day:**  
    - **Weightlifting Days:** Emphasis on lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats (e.g., grilled chicken/tofu, quinoa/brown rice, steamed vegetables, avocado).
    - **Cardio/HIIT Days:** Focus on foods that fuel endurance, including a mix of proteins, carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables (e.g., salmon/legumes, sweet potatoes/whole-grain pasta, mixed greens, fresh fruits).

### C. Performance Tracking

- **Logging Details:**  
  - **Weightlifting Sessions:** Log rough data including sets, reps, and weights.
  - **Cardio/HIIT Sessions:** Log duration and distance.
  
- **Data Use:**  
  - The system uses these logs to adjust the weekly plan automatically by incrementally increasing workout intensity (e.g., weights or repetitions) according to progression guidelines.

### D. Automatic Plan Updates

- **Mechanism:**  
  - At the end of each week, the system reviews logged performance data and automatically updates the following week’s plan to ensure continuous progression.
  
### E. Static Weekly Plan Generation

- **Content of the Weekly Plan:**  
  - Detailed exercise sessions with tailored warm-up, cool-down, and recovery routines.
  - A general food list with recommendations differentiated by workout type.
  - The plan is static for the week, allowing the user to consult it at their convenience.

## 3. Architecture & Technology Choices

### A. Frontend

- **Framework Options:**  
  - **Web:** React or Vue.js for a responsive and intuitive UI.  
  - **Mobile:** React Native or Flutter to support both iOS and Android platforms.
- **UI/UX Considerations:**  
  - An intuitive, clean interface with simple navigation for viewing the weekly plan and entering performance logs.
  - Minimal design—no fixed UI guidelines provided, so developers are free to propose a design that emphasizes ease of use.

### B. Backend

- **API Layer:**  
  - Develop RESTful endpoints (or GraphQL if preferred) to handle data operations such as retrieving the weekly plan, logging performance data, and processing automatic updates.
- **Framework Options:**  
  - Node.js with Express, or Python (e.g., Flask/Django) for rapid development.
- **Plan Generation Module:**  
  - A dedicated module that processes previous performance data and applies progression algorithms to update workout and food recommendations automatically.

### C. Data Storage & Handling

- **Database:**  
  - A lightweight database (e.g., SQLite for mobile and IndexedDB for web or a small cloud-based solution if data sync is desired).
- **Data Models:**
  - **User Performance Logs:**  
    - **Weightlifting Log:** Date, session type, exercise name, sets, reps, weight.  
    - **Cardio/HIIT Log:** Date, session type, duration, distance.
  - **Weekly Plan:**  
    - Structure to include workout sessions (with exercise details and warm-up/cool-down routines) and a food plan (general categories with examples).
- **Data Flow:**  
  - **Input:** User enters performance data after each session.  
  - **Processing:** The backend module processes this data to determine progression (e.g., slight increases in weight/reps or modifications in exercise selection).  
  - **Output:** A new weekly plan is generated and made available via the frontend.

## 4. Error Handling Strategies

### A. Input Validation

- **Client-Side:**  
  - Validate user inputs for performance logs (ensure numeric fields for weights, reps, duration, and distance are within reasonable ranges).
- **Server-Side:**  
  - Re-validate inputs to prevent corrupted data entries.
  - Use clear error messages for invalid inputs.

### B. API & Data Processing Errors

- **Graceful Degradation:**  
  - If automatic plan updates fail, revert to the previous week’s plan and notify the user with a non-intrusive error message.
- **Error Logging:**  
  - Implement logging (via services like Sentry or similar) to track API failures or unexpected errors.
- **Fallback Mechanism:**  
  - Allow manual triggering of plan generation in case of automated update failures.

### C. UI Error Feedback

- **User Notifications:**  
  - Provide real-time feedback for failed data submissions.
  - Use modals or inline alerts to inform the user of any issues and suggest corrective actions.

## 5. Testing Plan

### A. Unit Testing

- **Modules to Test:**  
  - **Plan Generator Module:** Validate that progression guidelines are correctly applied based on sample performance data.
  - **Data Logging Functions:** Test data validation and storage routines.
- **Tools:**  
  - Jest or Mocha (for JavaScript/Node.js)  
  - PyTest (if using Python)

### B. Integration Testing

- **API Endpoints:**  
  - Test communication between the frontend and backend to ensure data retrieval and submission work seamlessly.
  - Validate that automatic plan updates correctly integrate with logged performance data.
- **Tools:**  
  - Postman for API testing  
  - Cypress for full integration testing in web applications

### C. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

- **User Flow Simulation:**  
  - Simulate a complete user cycle: logging in, entering performance data, viewing the updated weekly plan, and checking food recommendations.
- **Tools:**  
  - Selenium or Cypress

### D. UI/UX Testing

- **Cross-Platform Validation:**  
  - Test on various devices (desktop, tablets, smartphones) and browsers to ensure responsiveness.
  - Perform usability tests to ensure that the navigation, data entry, and plan display are intuitive.

### E. Error and Recovery Testing

- **Simulated Failures:**  
  - Test for scenarios like network failures, invalid data entry, and backend processing errors.
  - Verify that appropriate error messages are displayed and fallback mechanisms (such as manual plan generation) are activated.

## 6. Summary & Next Steps

This specification details a modular, scalable approach to build a personal exercise and food planning system that is cross-platform and automatically adapts based on user performance. The system emphasizes:

- A clear separation of concerns between the plan generation, performance tracking, and UI layers.
- A lightweight yet robust data handling approach using local storage or simple databases.
- Thorough error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.
- Comprehensive testing strategies to verify functionality across the entire stack.
